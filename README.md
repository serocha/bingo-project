# Bingo
This is a pair project for school that aims to recreate a game of bingo using JavaFX. Rather than using numbers, pictures are used for the cells.

## Scope
Our initial concept is:
  - To create the board in FXML and style it with CSS
  - Generate a new board on button click and start the drawing
  - Cells will be drawn randomly on a timer, evaluating win conditions and stopping if there's a winning combo
  - Provide quality user feedback on which elements are chosen and the game state

## Stretch Goals
  - Scale up to four boards onscreen using modular programming
  - Show the chosen element when drawn
