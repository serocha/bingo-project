# Bingo
This is a pair project for school that aims to recreate a game of bingo using JavaFX.<br>
Rather than using numbers, pictures are used for the cells.<br>
<br>

## Scope
Our initial concept is the following:<br>
  - To create the board in FXML and style it with CSS
  - On button click, generate a random board and start the drawing
  - Cells will be picked randomly on a timer
  - Evaluate win conditions and stop if there's a winning combo
  - Provide quality user feedback on which elements are chosen and the game state<br>
<br>

## Stretch Goals
Provided we meet our initial criteria in a timely manner, we plan to:<br>
  - Scale up to show four boards simultaneously using modular programming
  - Create a "staging" area to showcase which cell was last drawn
  - Add extra cell types to increase board variety
